### I’m a photographer. Can I be listed in PIC?

Given the ubiquity of cameras in the digital age, it’s simply not possible for us to maintain biographies for all contemporary photographers. To maintain PIC as a useful research and discovery tool, we include photographers in the collections of public institutions, or who are otherwise newsworthy. If your work is in a museum somewhere, ask them to contact us with their list of photographers. We also include many contemporary photographers with biographies in Wikipedia and WikiData, which maintain their own standards of notability. We regularly update PIC with new entries found there.



### I have a collection of photographs. Will PIC link to it?

PIC does not track private collections or the stables of commercial galleries. If you are a museum, library, historical society, or other archive which is open to the public, we’d love to learn more about your photograph collection. Contact us!



### Why are there so many people on a tiny island off the west coast of Africa?

That’s not actually an island, and there’s not actually anyone there. That point is located at the coordinates 0’ latitude &amp; 0’ longitude, and we use it to map information when we don’t know a location (in the cartography world, it’s often called “[Null Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island)”). If, for instance, we know someone was born in 1872, but we don’t know where, we put the point on Null Island. You can help us evacuate the island by finding locations we’re missing!



### I have information PIC lacks, or I’ve spotted an error. How do I contribute or request a correction?

Please let us know! Use the feedback link in the bottom right of the map. It is helpful if you include the Record ID number to identify the photographer in question. That ID can be found after the Name, Nationality and Dates of the constituent.



### If PIC is about photographer’s identities, why is the map so prominent?

Time and place can be essential information if you’re trying to identify a photographer. With hundreds of entries for people with the last name “Williams”, it would be really inefficient to scroll through, and click into, each entry to find the “Williams” active in the location you’re looking for. Also, place-names can change over time, and national borders move, so the map allows you to browse for studios in Saint Petersburg, even if the city was called Leningrad at the time. Also, PIC data skews heavily toward the United States and Europe, but we want to represent the whole of photo history. It’s important to be able to see at a glance where we have more work to do. Plus, maps are just fun!



### Where did all these photographer biographies come from?

We’ve listed all of our sources in each record so you can double check our work. It’s a mix of trusted books, databases and websites published by photography scholars, as well as Wikipedia and Wikidata. When a source is a US Census, City or Business Directory, Military Records or Death Records, that means NYPL staff has conducted original research on the subject. (See Background for more information on the George Eastman House database)

### Can I get the data?

Yes. The data is available for download from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/NYPL/pic-data). You can also export the first 1000 search results from the [map interface](/map).

### What technology is behind this map?

The map is an experimental interface that makes use of [CesiumJS](http://cesiumjs.org/), a JavaScript library for 3D maps. CesiumJS is built on top of [WebGL](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL), a technology for high-performance 3D graphics [supported by the latest browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=webgl) without plug-ins. We wanted to explore the possibilities offered by WebGL for visualizing and interacting with large, geographic datasets. We are also using [ElasticSearch](//www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) to filter the data in many facets. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to [contact us on Twitter](//twitter.com/nypl_labs).
