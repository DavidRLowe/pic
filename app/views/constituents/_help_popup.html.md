### How To

We hope you find PIC intuitive to use, but we understand that you may find some things quirky or confusing. Let us know if you’re having problems, and we’ll consider how we can make PIC more useful for you. In the meantime, here’s a tour of the interface and how to use it.


The screen is divided into three sections: the search column to the left, the search results in the center, and the map. Any of them can be minimized by clicking the X in the upper right of the column.


In the top right corner of the map, you can click the grid icon to select how you’d like to view the map- flat (default) or as a globe.

On the left of this is the location search bar. This lets you zoom to a particular place on the map. This doesn’t affect what information is displayed on the map, it just lets you look at a location up close.

In the top left, you’ll find in plain English what the map is showing you. This will change as you click on points or use search or filters in the search column.


In the leftmost column you can search and filter the PIC data.

Search for a name with the search bar. If you don’t find what you’re looking for, be less specific. Try just a last name. This may give you too many results. If you know where your person or studio existed, zoom to that location by using the location search bar on the map. You can also set a specific time frame to limit the search results. Setting a beginning and end year will show only events that happened within that range.

Use filters, such as Gender, Process or Collection, etc. to further limit your results.

Note that the Location filter changes to a set of geographic coordinates when you click a point on the map. PIC then shows only the photographers or studios who are in that specific location (and who match all other criteria you have selected). If you want to see all the search results, regardless of their location, simply select Any from the Location filter.

To start over completely, select Clear All Filters (located just above the search bar).


The results of your search and filtering are displayed as a list in the center column. Click on a name to reveal more information and to more closely examine locations associated with that name. Show Locations zooms and recenters the map, and Connect Locations, well, connects those dots from birth to death, and chronologically in between.
