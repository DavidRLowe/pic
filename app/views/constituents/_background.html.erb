<p>I’m David Lowe, Photography Specialist at the New York Public Library, and the primary editor of PIC. Since about 2003, I’ve been collecting, aggregating, cleaning and researching the information presented here. I came to my position in the library's Photography Collection circuitously- by way of art school, various jobs in art handling and a commercial gallery- bypassing any practical education or experience in either photo history or archive management. I rather stumbled my way into a secretarial position at NYPL. At that time, the Photography Collection was maintained by a single staffer, whose position I assumed when she left in 2002. Thanks to budget uncertainty and hiring freezes, I would remain the sole steward of this monumental, encyclopedic collection until the hiring of curator Stephen Pinson in 2005. Desperate to make the unmanageable manageable, I immediately began a thorough survey of the collection, to note the locations of our cataloged material, and to make some record of our backlog of uncataloged photographs. This allowed me to begin rearranging our physical collection- to store all of a photographer’s work together, arranged alphabetically. So from day one, photographers’ identities have been central to my work at NYPL.</p>

<p>At that time the <%= link_to "George Eastman House", "https://eastman.org/" %> (now the George Eastman Museum) hosted a database of biographical data on some 90,000 photographers. It was a clunky DOS interface, it was rife with duplicates and entries with too little information to be useful, but the wealth of good information it contained was absolutely invaluable to my work. Its original editors had left the museum, no one was maintaining it, and it became increasingly unstable- sometimes offline for days or weeks at a time. Fearful of permanently losing it, I set out to make my own copy of it. I found that if I searched “*” it would give me the entire list of 90,000 entries- 20 names on the screen at a time. Naturally, I copied and pasted them all into a spreadsheet (twice, actually, to ensure I’d not made a mistake). Because this gave me only the names, nationalities and dates of the photographers, I manually checked those that seemed to be duplicate entries or names whose data was too scant to be of use. After this initial cleaning, my list was reduced to about 65,000 “good” names. In 2010, the GEH database crashed one final time.</p>

<p>Believing that I alone had all of this information, I continued the work of collecting and enriching my photographer data, checking it against other big lists and biographical dictionaries, adding missing names or dates, upgrading initials to full names, adding genders, addresses and any other useful information I could find. (As it turned out, the original editors of the GEH database, Andrew Eskind and Greg Drake, had a full copy, and it is again online at <%= link_to "photographydatabase.org", "//photographydatabase.org" %>). I migrated my sprawling spreadsheet into the Photography Collection’s cataloging database, where it has continued to expand and deepen (as of 2016, there are roughly 115,000 photographers in PIC).</p>

<p>While I have spent countless hours collecting, cleaning and researching the information found here, I am deeply indebted to, and grateful for, the excellent work of all the researchers whose databases, websites and books are indexed here. Thanks also to Stephen Pinson, my colleagues in the Photography Collection, and Mauricio Giraldo and Ben Vershbow of the NYPL Labs team who have supported and encouraged the creation of the Photographers' Identities Catalog.</p>
